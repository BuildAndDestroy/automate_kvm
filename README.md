# BETA

Currently these scripts do not work, the roadmap compiles of getting the parsed arguments create then apply the subprocesses. An example command will look like:

# EXAMPLE

\#  kvm_installer -n <hostname> -c <# of VCPUs> -r <# of ram in MB> -l <location of mirror for install> -o <Operating System name like "rhel7"> -d <# of Gigs for volume size> -b <Network bridge adapter> -i <directory and file name for kickstart> -e <additional arguments like output to terminal and the kickstart file name>

# INSTALL

\# pip install automate_kvm/.


# UPGRADE

\# pip install --upgrade automate_kvm/.


# BUGS

Please open an issue on github and give terminal output. Please give details on how how to reproduce the issue as well.
